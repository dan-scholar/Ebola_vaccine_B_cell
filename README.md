Venous peripheral blood (up to 3ml) was collected directly in TempusTM RNA tube immediately pre-vaccination, then 10 days post-first vaccine and 7 days post-second vaccine. RNA was extracted using the Tempus™ spin RNAisolationkit (Invitrogen, USA). Eluted RNA was quantified using Qubit™ RNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and quality control was conducted usingthe Agilent RNA ScreenTape assay on the 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent, USA). RNA was ribodepleted and globin depleted using Ribo-ZeroTM Gold rRNA removal Kit (Illumina, USA). RNA was converted to cDNA, second-strand cDNA synthesis incorporated dUTP. The cDNA was end-repaired, A-tailed and adapter-ligated and prior to amplification, samples underwent uridine digestion. The prepared libraries were size selected, multiplexed and quality controlled before 75bp paired-end sequencing (HiSeq4000). Sequencing was conducted at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics (Oxford, UK). The sequencing data were aligned against the whole human (Homo sapiens) genome build GRCh38 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml), using STAR (version 2.6.1d). Gene features were counted using HTSeq (version 0.11.1), using human gene annotation general transfer format version GRCh38.92 (www.ensembl.org).
